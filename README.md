## About the book
_Mastering Xamarin.Forms_ is a step-by-step, code-rich guide that will walk you through building a real-world mobile app with Xamarin.Forms from start to finish. Starting with an app built with the basics of the Xamarin.Forms toolkit, you will go through several advanced topics to create a solution architecture rich with the benefits of good design patterns and best practices. Each chapter builds upon the app showing you how to maximize its testability, flexibility, overall quality, and user experience.
